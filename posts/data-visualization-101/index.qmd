# Two methods for plot building
+ functional method
+ object-oriented method

# using `matplotlib`

```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = range(1, 10)
y = [1,2,3,4,0,4,3,2,1]

plt.plot(x,y)

```

## from pandas object

```{python}
mtcars = pd.read_csv("mtcars.csv")
mtcars.head()
mpg = mtcars["mpg"]

mpg.plot()
```

```{python}
df = mtcars[["cyl", "wt", "mpg"]]

df.plot()
```

### bar chart

```{python}
plt.bar(x, y)
```

```{python}
df.plot(kind = "barh")

```

### Pie chart

```{python}
x = [1,2,3,4,0.5]
plt.pie(x)
plt.show()
# plt.savefig("pie.png")
```
